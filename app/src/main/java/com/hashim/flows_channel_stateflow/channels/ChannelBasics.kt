* Closing and iteration over channels

Unlike a queue, a channel can be closed to indicate that no more elements are coming.
* On the receiver side it is convenient to use a regular for loop to receive elements
*  from the channel.
*  A close is like sending a special close token to the channel. The iteration
* stops as soon as this close token is received, so there is a guarantee that all previously
* sent elements before the close are received:

/*
* Building channel producersï»¿
* The pattern where a coroutine is producing a sequence of elements is quite common.
* This is a part of producer-consumer pattern that is often found in concurrent code.
* Such a producer can be abstracted out into a function that takes channel as its parameter,
* There is a convenient coroutine builder named produce that makes it easy to do it right
* on producer side, and an extension function consumeEach, that replaces a for loop on the
consumer side:
