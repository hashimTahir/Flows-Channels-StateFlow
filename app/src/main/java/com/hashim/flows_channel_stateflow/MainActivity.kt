    *     A builder function for Flow type is called flow.

    Code inside the flow { ... } builder block can suspend.

    The simple function is no longer marked with suspend modifier.

    Values are emitted from the flow using emit function.

    Values are collected from the flow using collect function.
    *
    * Flows are cold streams similar to sequences â€” the code inside a flow builder
    * does not run until the flow is collected.
    *
    *
    *
    * This is a key reason the simple function (which returns a flow) is not marked with suspend modifier.
    *  By itself, simple() call returns quickly and does not wait for anything.
    * The flow starts every time it is collected, that is why we see "Flow started" when we call collect again.
